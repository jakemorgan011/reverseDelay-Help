# reverseDelay-Help
a working reverse delay dsp.

recent additions:
- time sync added
- hanning window added to playback as a alternative to iterpolation

problems:
  - DAW clock sync is officially working.
  - however, I need to link with the playhead a little better
  - AND the temposync button is not updating in real time with the plugin.
  - UI is using default assets.

OTHER than that, this dsp works. I haven't seen any simple reverse delays out in the wild so I hope this is found useful to someone.
