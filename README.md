# reverseDelay-Help
a "working" reverse delay dsp.

# recent additions:
- time sync added
- hanning window added to playback as a alternative to iterpolation
- new UI.
- better knobs
- timesync button (synced with bpm from daw but not the playhead yet.)

# problems:
- The buffer seems to fill up and start to clip when it is swapped to tempoSync.
- the temposyncReverseDelay cpp file is a mess rn. there are multiple algorithms that are commented out but the one that works at the moment is the one that is live in the code.
- feedback seems to cut off at random while the buffer is filling up.
